These are my first projects after completing MIT's 6.00.1x. Each project has its own folder in the repository.

Projects include:

- a PDF merge tool built using the PyPDF2 library (https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/). 

- a secure password checker to check if a given password has been hacked using the Have I Been Pwned API (https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3). The API allows the list of pwned accounts (email addresses and usernames) to be quickly searched via a RESTful service.
